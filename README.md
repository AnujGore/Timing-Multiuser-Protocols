# Timing Multiuser Protocols

Here we develop analytical and monte-carlo based methods to time multi-user entanglement distribution protocols.

We develop Shortest Path (SP) protocol first, and can be run through the SP.ipynb file.  

We develop the timings in seconds as well as time-slots.

The `analytical_approaches.py` file contains the analytical while the `ShortestPath` folder has the Monte-Carlo simulation. 

The last cells of the `SP.ipynb` file contain the ratio of the classical communication and quantum operational timings as well as the actual time in seconds.
